## About

The goal of disasteraidr is to have an easy way to download cleaned data
in R from various sources associated with disaster aid allocation in the
UNITED STATES. This is an ongoing project with the University of
Maryland Hazards and Infrastructures team. Currently â€˜cleanedâ€™ datasets
come from HUD, NOAA, and FEMA

## Installation

You can install the development version of disasteraidr from
[Github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etam4260/disasteraidr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to load in the data:

``` r
library(disasteraidr)
# The package currently contains 6 datasets:
head(data("hma"))
#> [1] "hma"
head(data("noaadata"))
#> Warning in data("noaadata"): data set 'noaadata' not found
#> [1] "noaadata"
head(data("ihp"))
#> [1] "ihp"
head(data("cdbgdr"))
#> [1] "cdbgdr"
head(data("pa"))
#> [1] "pa"
head(data("dd"))
#> [1] "dd"
```
