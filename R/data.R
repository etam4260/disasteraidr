#' @title Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects
#'
#' @description "Hazard mitigation planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing
#' the impact of disasters.
#' It begins with state, tribal and local governments identifying
#' natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
#' After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
#' people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key
#' to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction."
